<SILENCE>	Are you ready?	ask_ready
No, this exercise is so long.	Make large circular movements in a clockwise direction with your left hand. First hold your hand to the left of the body, as if you were waving. With the circular movements, you can imagine that you are wiping across a windowpane. After ten repetitions, change direction. 0011S	general_description
